1)We implemented the tripletcount long task as longcoroutine and longfiber in 2.1 and 2.2 and they are displayed as menu items.
2)For the fiberscheduler part we implemented recursive functions towerofhanoi and fibrec(recursive version of fibonacci numbers)
which are of O(2^n) complexity and added menu items for both of them.
